### Design Considerations

The **INSERT APP NAME HERE** was meticulously crafted based on these key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app’s design prioritised an intuitive and user-friendly interface, aiming for a seamless user experience.

2. **Responsiveness**: The app was meticulously crafted to ensure optimal performance across various screen sizes, with a special focus on device compatibility.

3. **Simplicity**: The design adopts a minimalist approach, prioritising core features without overwhelming the user with excessive complexity.

4. **Performance**: Code optimization was a top priority to ensure fast response times and minimal battery consumption.

### GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using GitHub for version control. Regularly committed and pushed code changes allowed for collaborative coding, ensuring project integrity.

GitHub Actions was used to automate the build and deployment process. This includes running automated tests to verify app functionality, compiling the app into APK and AAB files for distribution, and uploading these build artefacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow automatically builds and tests the project every time changes are pushed, simplifying the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

### Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: Seriously struggled to push the code to the classroom repository.
   - **Solution**: I used the terminal on MacOS and found a way to push the code.
   - 
2. **Challenge 2**: Debugging the initial code in the early days of the app due to an error in the Android Manifest
   - **Solution**: Had to declare the activities: (android:name="").

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging and pushing the code to the Github repository.

### Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides core INSERT APP FUNCTIONALITY, there are several features that could be added in the future, such as:

**INSERT 1ST ENHANCEMENT**: 

**2ND ENHANCEMENT**:

**3RD ENHANCEMENT**:
